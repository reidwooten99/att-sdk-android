 * Network Broadcast Receiver object is used to listen the network connectivity changes.

 * Network connectivity changes can be due one of the following events:
 * 	1.Current network interface being disconnected
 *  2.A new network interface being connected
 *  3.Handover (also known as "fallover") between two network interfaces (usually as a
 *    result of one of the two events above), such as WiFi being activated as a result of 
 *    user coming home and all network traffic will be routed through WiFi as opposed to 3G.
